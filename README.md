# Client Installation Tutorial
## PC (highly recommended, one click install)

Download and extract zip from [PC_NOVA_CN](https://tenshis-archive.duckdns.org/d/Tenshi's%20Archive/Game%20Files/Yostar%20Games/Stellar%20Sora/0.1.0/CN/PC_NOVA_CN.7z)


## Android (NOT recommended)

Download and install the apk from [APK_NOVA](https://tenshis-archive.duckdns.org/d/Tenshi's%20Archive/Game%20Files/Yostar%20Games/Stellar%20Sora/0.1.0/CN/星塔旅人.apk)

After installing the apk on your emulator, you have two ways of installing the resources needed

1. Manual install - download and extract [ANDROID_NOVA_CN](https://tenshis-archive.duckdns.org/d/Tenshi's%20Archive/Game%20Files/Yostar%20Games/Stellar%20Sora/0.1.0/CN/星塔旅人.apk) and move them into the game files on your emulator

2. Automatic install - run [android_update.bat](android_update.bat) (change the ip in [android_update.py](android_update.py) to your own ip first) and Novaria Server, after joining game the resources will download automatically.


#### I really do not recommend the android version, many things can go wrong, you are better off installing the pc client in one click lol

# Running

1. IMPORTANT: change the ip in [proxy.py](proxy.py) into your own ip 
2. Run proxy.bat
3. Run Novaria
4. Join game

## Special Thanks

- Tenshi - (for hosting all the resources that was needed and creating the custom cdn <3)
